# Machine Translation Project
This is a project from the natural language processing nanodegree from udacity

(https://br.udacity.com/course/natural-language-processing-nanodegree--nd892)

In this notebook, we will build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. Your completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation.

Preprocess - It'll convert text to sequence of integers.
Models Creates models which accepts a sequence of integers as input and returns a probability distribution over possible translations. We will try some basic types of neural networks that are often used for machine translation, in the end will build based on the lessons learnes your own model!
Prediction In the end the model will run on some sample English text.

## To have a look on the programm open the machine_translation_github.ipynb
